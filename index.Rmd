2. <span class='answer'>`r (median(c(130, 138, 142, 146, 152, 153, 157, 161)))`</span>
3. <span class='answer'>`r (min(c(130, 138, 142, 146, 152, 153, 157, 161)))`</span> <span class='answer'>`r (max(c(130, 138, 142, 146, 152, 153, 157, 161)))`</span>

*** .hint
Mean = sum of all observations divided by the number of observations.  To calculate the median, put the numbers in order, and find the one in the middle.  If there are two middle numbers, average them.  The range is the smallest and the largest numbers.
